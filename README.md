# 📚 Sprint 4 | API

## 🎯 Goals

-   Understand how an API works.
-   Learn about other free APIs.
-   Creation of unit tests .

### Key Tasks for the Project

1. **Display Jokes from API**

    - Fetch and display a joke from the provided API on app start.
    - Implement a "Next joke" button to fetch and display a new joke.

2. **Initial Layout**

    - Create a basic layout for the main screen, placing all UI elements (joke, buttons, etc.).

3. **Joke Assessment and Reporting**

    - Create an array to store joke assessments.
    - Save the assessment date in ISO format and a score (1-3) for each joke.
    - Add three buttons for scoring each joke (1 = worst, 3 = best).
    - Allow users to skip voting or change their score before moving to the next joke.
    - Update and log the array to the console.

4. **Weather Information Integration**

    - Fetch and display weather information from a weather API on app start.

5. **Alternate Joke Sources**

    - Integrate at least one additional joke API.
    - Alternate or randomly select jokes from different APIs.

6. **Responsive and Enhanced Layout**
    - Refine the website layout for responsiveness and improved user experience.
    - Display weather as an icon instead of text.
    - (Bonus) Implement dynamic container shapes (SVGs) that change with each new joke.
